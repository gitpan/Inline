# Zilla-Dist

Inline currently uses a packaging system called Zilla-Dist (from CPAN). You
will need this to run some of the Makefile targets. Unless you are actually
releasing this code to CPAN, you probably don't need it.

If you do need Zilla::Dist, just install it from CPAN. It currently takes a
long time to install, but you only need to install it once. The fastest way to
install it is:

  cpanm -n Zilla::Dist
